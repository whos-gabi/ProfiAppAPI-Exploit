# ProfiApp(RO) API Exploit
### Free money? ðŸ’¶
ðŸ”° Bug exploitation for the [Profi app](https://www.profi.ro/loialitate/). This is a simple Python script that automatically scans qr's emulating a user being at checkouts and getting 1% cahsback from current processed bill. (Not even being in the store)
And so you can get peoples cashback to your account(s) just knowing some qr codes from checkouts.

## Usage

Download App Here:
[Profi Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ro.profi.store&pli=1) - [Profi iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ro/app/profi/id1569196033)

Clone the repository, install the dependencies
using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
and then create a file named `config.json` formated as `sample.config.json` with your data.
**QR Codes**
To add qr codes in `config.json` you need to scan the qr from the shop checkout and get the text from it that looks somethink like this `https://qr.profi.ro/checkin?l=9000009999969`, therefore you need to add only `9000009999969` to the "qrCodes" list in `config.json`.

Run the script using `python main.py`.

**Issues**
For any errors you get, please try checking if the username and password is correct or the correct format of config. Otherwise, create an issue.

**Long Term Exploaitation**
The app has a rate limit and will block you after a few requests. You can use a timer to run the script every 24 hours to claim the daily prizes and avoid being blocked.

> Note: The script is not meant to be used for long term exploitation, as it is against the Profi app's terms of service.
> The following output means your has been blocked:

```
{
    "name": "CheckInBlocked",
    "message": "Check-in blocked for a member because of suspicious activity"
}
```
